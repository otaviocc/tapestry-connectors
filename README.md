Tapestry Connectors is an open-source project providing additional connectors for [Tapestry](https://github.com/TheIconfactory/Tapestry), an iOS app for displaying information from multiple sources in a unified way.

Do these connectors improve your life in any way? If so, you can show your appreciation by buying me a coffee ❤️ ☕️
